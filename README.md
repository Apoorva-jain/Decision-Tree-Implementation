Expected Output: 
Level 0 Count of 0(False) = 1 Count of 1(True) = 3 Current Entropy is = 0.811278124459 Splitting on feature X1 with gain ratio 0.311278124459

Level 1 Count of 0 = 1 Count of 1 = 1 Current Entropy is = 1.0 Splitting on feature X2 with gain ratio 1.0

Level 2 Count of 0 = 1 Current Entropy is = 0.0 Reached leaf Node

Level 2 Count of 1 = 1 Current Entropy is = 0.0 Reached leaf Node

Level 1 Count of 1 = 2 Current Entropy is = 0.0 Reached leaf Node
